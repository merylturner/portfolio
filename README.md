## Navigation
Located in header, use hamburger icon - will hide when user is in mobile mode, and will expand on a larger screen when the user clicks. 
Everything is within one page, so the links will be to other parts of the page

## About Me
Little blurb on my homepage that has an image and short description of myself. 
*(STRETCH GOAL: to add icons of 'what I do' example - Web Development, Graphic Design, etc)*

##Projects
Create template for all projects including image, title, date and a small description of the project. 

## General Styling
Horizontal Rules to divide your content
Mobile First Design, create column flex box of items within their div, and set to expand when on a larger screen
